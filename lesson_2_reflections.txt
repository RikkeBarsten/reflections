What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When a repository is initialized, a file is created, that keep track of the history 
of the repository. If the repository is not initialized, I won't be able to make 
commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area lets you select what parts of a working directory to commit to 
the repository. It offers flexibility when working with versions.
