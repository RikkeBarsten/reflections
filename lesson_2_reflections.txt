What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When a repository is initialized, a file is created, that keep track of the history 
of the repository. If the repository is not initialized, I won't be able to make 
commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area lets you select what parts of a working directory to commit to 
the repository. It offers flexibility when working with versions.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can add files to staging area, then run git diff, to check out all the diffs, 
and make sure that they are a logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized? How would branches help?
Branches are helpful, when I want to test some experimental feature. The branch 
could keep my master 'clean' while I'm working on the experimental feature. I 
could make code improvements on master branch, while working on the experimental 
feature.

How do diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Diagrams shows the commits and their parent commits, so that it is easy to see 
if the branches, and where they parted.
