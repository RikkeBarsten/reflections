When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When I need to share a project or collaborate with others on a project. Having a
remote repository is also a way to backup your data, if something goes wrong on y
ou local machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with you remote reposistory?
If you are working with someone else on the same remote, you might want to
control when your master is updated.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
Forks exists only on GitHub. A fork is like a clone, but the repository
'creator' is credited. A clone is a copy of a repository. A branch is a new line
of commits in an existing repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
You can use git status and git diff on the local copy of the remote, and use
that copy to merge into your local master when needed.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
I could send the files zipped in email, or put the zip-file online. The
collaborator could then review the files. It would be easier not having to
create branches and pull requests, but harder to know which version is the
working version, and harder to work simultaneously on the same project.
