When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I need to share a project or collaborate with others on a project. Having a remote 
repository is also a way to backup your data, if something goes wrong on you local 
machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with you remote reposistory?
If you are working with someone else on the same remote, you might want to control 
when your master is updated.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
Forks exists only on GitHub. A fork is like a clone, but the repository 'owner' is 
credited. A clone is a copy of a repository. A branch is a new line of commits in 
an existing repository.
