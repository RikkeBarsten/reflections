When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I need to share a project or collaborate with others on a project. Having a remote 
repository is also a way to backup your data, if something goes wrong on you local 
machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with you remote reposistory?
I you are working with someone else on the same remote, you might want to control 
when your master is updated.
